        "\n",
        "Classical machine learning relies on using statistics to determine relationships between features and labels, and can be very effective for creating predictive models. However, a massive growth in the availability of data coupled with advances in the computing technology required to process it has led to the emergence of new machine learning techniques that mimic the way the brain processes information in a structure called an artificial neural network.\n",

        "## Creating a Neural Network with Tensorflow\n",

        "\n",
        "> The iris classification model is a very common machine learning example, and the iris dataset is often the basis for \"hello world\" sample code for a wide range of machine learning frameworks. In reality, you can solve this problem easily using classical machine learning techniques without the need for a deep learning model; but it's a useful, easy to understand dataset with which to demonstrate the principles of neural networks in this notebook.\n",

Since this is a commonly used sample dataset, it is built-in to the *scikit-learn* machine learning library, so we'll get it from there. As with any supervised learning problem, we'll then split the dataset into a set of records with which to train the model, and a smaller set with which to validate the trained model."
