    "# Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "*Supervised* machine learning techniques involve training a model to operate on a set of *features* and predict a *label* using a dataset that includes some already-known label values. The training process *fits* the features to the known labels to define a general function that can be applied to new features for which the labels are unknown, and predict them. You can think of this function like this, in which ***y*** represents the label we want to predict and ***x*** represents the features the model uses to predict it.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = f(x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, *x* is actually a *vector* that consists of multiple feature values, so to be a little more precise, the function could be expressed like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = f([x_1, x_2, x_3, ...])$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of training the model is to find a function that performs some kind of calculation to the *x* values that produces the result *y*. We do this by applying a machine learning *algorithm* that tries to fit the *x* values to a calculation that produces *y* reasonably accurately for all of the cases in the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of machine learning algorithms for supervised learning, and they can be broadly divided into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **_Regression_ algorithms**: Algorithms that predict a *y* value that is a numeric value, such as the price of a house or the number of sales transactions.\n",
    "- **_Classification_ algorithms**: Algorithms that predict to which category, or *class*, an observation belongs. The *y* value in a classification model is a vector of probability values between 0 and 1, one for each class, indicating the probability of the observation belonging to each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll focus on *regression*, using an example based on a real study in which data for a bicycle sharing scheme was collected and used to predict the number of rentals based on seasonality and weather conditions.

    "The first step in any machine learning project is to explore the data that you will use to train a model. The goal of this exploration is to try to understand the relationships between its attributes; in particular, any apparent correlation between the *features* and the *label* your model will try to predict. This may require some work to detect and fix issues in the data (such as dealing with missing values, errors, or outlier values), deriving new feature columns by transforming or combining existing features (a process known as *feature engineering*), *normalizing* numeric features (values you can measure or count) so they're on a similar scale, and *encoding* categorical features (values that represent discrete categories) as numeric indicators.\n",

    "### Scaling numeric features\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalizing numeric features so they're on the same scale prevents features with large values from producing coefficients that disproportionately affect the predictions. For example, suppose your data includes the following numeric features:\n",

    "### Encoding categorical variables\n",

    "Machine learning models work best with numeric features rather than text values, so you generally need to convert categorical features into numeric representations.  For example, suppose your data includes the following categorical feature. \n",

    "|  0   |\n",
    "|  1   |\n",
    "|  2   |\n",
    "\n",

These enable us to define a set of preprocessing steps that end with an algorithm. You can then fit the entire pipeline to the data, so that the model encapsulates all of the preprocessing steps as well as the regression algorithm. This is useful, because when we want to use the model to predict values from new data, we need to apply the same transformations (based on the same statistical distributions and category encodings used with the training data).\n",
