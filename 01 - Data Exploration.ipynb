    "# Exploring Data with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant part of a data scientist's role is to explore, analyze, and visualize data. There's a wide range of tools and programming languages that they can use to do this, and of the most popular approaches is to use Jupyter notebooks (like this one) and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a flexible programming language that is used in a wide range of scenarios; from web applications to device programming. It's extremely popular in the data science and machine learning community because of the many packages it supports for data analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll explore some of these packages, and apply basic techniques to analyze data. This is not intended to be a comprehensive Python programming exercise; or even a deep dive into data analysis. Rather, it's intended as a crash course in some of the common ways in which data scientists can use Python to work with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: If you've never used the Jupyter Notebooks environment before, there are a few things you should be aware of:\n",
    "> \n",
    "> - Notebooks are made up of *cells*. Some cells (like this one) contain *markdown* text, while others (like the one beneath this one) contain code.\n",
    "> - The notebook is connected to a Python *kernel* (you can see which one at the top right of the page - if you're running this notebook in an Azure Machine Learning compute instance it should be connected to the **Python 3.6 - AzureML** kernel). If you stop the kernel or disconnect from the server (for example, by closing and reopening the notebook, or ending and resuming your session), the output from cells that have been run will still be displayed; but any variables or functions defined in those cells will have been lost - you must rerun the cells before running any subsequent cells that depend on them.\n",
    "> - You can run each code cell by using the **&#9658; Run** button. The **&#9711;** symbol next to the kernel name at the top right will briefly turn to **&#9899;** while the cell runs before turning back to **&#9711;**.\n",
    "> - The output from each code cell will be displayed immediately below the cell.\n",
    "> - Even though the code cells can be run individually, some variables used in the code are global to the notebook. That means that you should run all of the code cells <u>**in order**</u>. There may be dependencies between code cells, so if you skip a cell, subsequent cells might not run correctly.\n",

    "The box plot shows the distribution of the grade values in a different format to the histogram. The *box* part of the plot shows where the inner two *quartiles* of the data reside - so in this case, half of the grades are between approximately 36 and 63. The *whiskers* extending from the box show the outer two quartiles; so the other half of the grades in this case are between 0 and 36 or 63 and 100. The line in the box indicates the *median* value.\n",

    "All of the measurements of central tendency are right in the middle of the data distribution, which is symmetric with values becoming progressively lower in both directions from the middle.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this distribution in more detail, you need to understand that statistics is fundamentally about taking *samples* of data and using probability functions to extrapolate information about the full *population* of data. For example, the student data consists of 22 samples, and for each sample there is a grade value. You can think of each sample grade as a variable that's been randomly selected from the set of all grades awarded for this course. With enough of these random variables, you can calculate something called a *probability density function*, which estimates the distribution of grades for the full population.\n",

In most real-world cases, it's easier to consider outliers as being values that fall below or above percentiles within which most of the data lie. For example, the following code uses the Pandas **quantile** function to exclude observations below the 0.01th percentile (the value above which 99% of the data reside)."

It provides a measure of variance in the data on the same scale as the data itself (so grade points for the Grade distribution and hours for the StudyHours distribution). The higher the standard deviation, the more variance there is when comparing values in the distribution to the distribution mean - in other words, the data is more spread out.\n",

Then we can form a linear equation that calculates a new *y* value on that line for each of our *x* (*StudyHours*) values - to avoid confusion, we'll call this new *y* value *f(x)* (because it's the output from a linear equation ***f***unction based on *x*). The difference between the original *y* (*Grade*) value and the *f(x)* value is the *error* between our regression line and the actual *Grade* achieved by the student. Our goal is to calculate the slope and intercept for a line with the lowest overall error.\n",
